  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com">Pomodoro Technique</a> at office, although I don&rsquo;t follow it strictly, the technique did improve my productivity, and it&rsquo;s very effective. I use <a href="http://www.tomighty.org/">Tomighty</a> desktop timer, it&rsquo;s free and opensource. Then for the todo list, I use Google Keep, I don&rsquo;t really record down how many <code>pomodori</code> I spend on a task. The main reason for me to apply <code>Pomodoro Technique</code> is to make me stay focus and concentrate. Google Keep is not dedicated application for todo list, its capability to support todo list simply enought for my requirements.</p>

<p>Just as other Google product, Google Keep interface is clean and minimal, they have Chrome App and Android App. And the best part of Google Keep is its sync function, you can modify your Google Keep on multiple devices and they all sync to your Google account.</p>

<p>Below is my practice to use Google Keep as my todo list.</p>

<ul>
<li>For everyday todo list, I create a Googe Keep entry, titled with the date.</li>
<li>I only keep recent few days&#8217; todo list, older entries will be archived</li>
<li>Every night, I will review today&rsquo;s todo list, copy those items that not finished and need to continue tomorrow to a new Keep entry, titled as tomorrow&rsquo;s date. Then add new list items if there are.</li>
<li>Then I will arrange those items in priority order</li>
<li>Next day, I will try to follow the order to finish the tasks.</li>
<li>Once a task is done, after marking as done, I will move it to the bottom of the list, then start work on the next item.</li>
<li>There is also a special Keep entry function as the pool to keep <code>Todo Items Later</code>. I constantly review and upate items in this entry.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are many note taking or todo list softwares, I also use <code>Evernote</code> and <code>Microsoft OneNote</code> for other purpose. So far, I am quite happy with the way I use Google Keep. You may use any note takeing software in whatever style, as long as it helps for your life or work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DR0PDNE/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DR0PDNE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zhuyong.me-20"><img class="left" src="/images/blogimg/2014-01-25-Chromecast.jpg" title="&#34;Chromecast On Amazon&#34;" alt="&#34;Chromecast On Amazon&#34;"></a></p>

<p>I ordered Chromecast from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DR0PDNE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DR0PDNE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zhuyong.me-20" title="">Amazon</a> one week back when it has promotional price of US$29.99 only.</p>

<p>I want to buy Chromecast even before I got my C720 Chromebook, but Chromecast is not selling in Singapore and it is not eligible for the free international shipping to Singapore for over US$125 spending, I don&rsquo;t want to spend over US$20 shipping fee to buy a product only cost US$29.99, so I wait.</p>

<p>One week earlier, I saw my colleage shopping on Amazon, and he always use Comegateway service to ship product from US to Singapore. So I ask if he can buy the Chromecast and ship together with his purchases. He happily agreed.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, DHL delivered to our office, I pay my colleague total S$46 (S$40 for the Chromecast and S$6 for the shared shipping fee), that&rsquo;s very cheap.</p>

<p>After went back home, I plugged Chromecast in to the HDMI slot on my TV, connected the USB power, then run <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app">Chromecast</a> app from my Android phone, the setup process was very easy, then wait for Chromecast to finish firmware updating. After that, everything was ready, so I run Youtube app from my phone and cast the famous <code>"London Bridge is Falling Down"</code> animation for my son. The video streaming was very smooth, no legging, not buffering, overall experience was nice.</p>

<p>But, there are only limited android apps that have Chromecast support, and most of the supported apps can&rsquo;t be used in Singapore. The function I want most is to cast the photos and video on my phone to TV. I took a lot of pictures and video for my two boys, I want to let them see themselves on photo and video, and the phone screen is way too small.</p>

<p>Google, please release the full power of Chromecast!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon I placed an order for 3 pieces of <a href="http://call-of-duty-ghosts.allure-eyewear.com/">Call Of Duty Ghosts By Allure Eyewear</a>. One for myself and the other two for my colleagues.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blogimg/2014-01-23-codg5-k.jpeg" title="&#34;Call Of Duy Ghosts By Allure Eyewear&#34;" alt="&#34;Call Of Duy Ghosts By Allure Eyewear&#34;"></p>

<p>One week ago, I didn&rsquo;t even know there are glasses specially designed for heavy computer user and gamers. One day, one of my colleagues said he was going to buy a glass from Amazon, ask me to search word <code>gunnar</code> to have a look. Then he said the glass can give eyes some relief for full day computer user like us, almost all professional gamer wear this kind of glass to protect their eyes. So I did some google about this eyewear. From reviews on various websites, the feedbacks are quite possitive and effective. So I decided to invest one to protect my precious eyes.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t buy those widely available eyewear from <code>gunnar</code> because I am a shortsighted person, and I already wear a pair of glass. I need to find the clip-on type of eyewear, and I only found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009OZSMEI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009OZSMEI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zhuyong.me-20">this</a> from Amazon, and it was out of stock, some unknown sellers sell it over US$60 at that time. Then I visited homepage of <code>gunnar</code>, I can&rsquo;t find the clip-on type, but shortsighted people can order customized glasses with a much higher prices. We haven&rsquo;t tried this kind of glasses before, invest over US$250 for a customized glass without known its effect is kind of risky. So we decided to wait for the stock come back for the clip-on type.</p>

<p>This afternoon, I visited amazon again and found they got stock and the price is only US$33.99, that&rsquo;s much cheaper compare to US$60. Although we need to pay over S$50 shipping fee for 3 pieces of the eyewear, my colleagues and I decided to place the order. Only by then, I noticed this eyewear is from <code>Allure Eyewear</code> instead of <code>gunnar</code>, no wonder I can&rsquo;t find this type from <code>gunnar</code> official website. So I googled again for reviews on <code>Allure Eyewear</code>, again, the reviews are good. And one comments over a review article mentioned the official website of <code>Allure Eyewear</code> sell <code>Call Of Duty Ghosts</code> cheaper than this older <code>Call of Duty Black Ops II</code>. That&rsquo;s good information before I place order.</p>

<p>So I visited <code>Allure Eyewear</code> website, and indeed, the new type is cheaper, only sell at US$24.99. And there international shipping is only US$20, much cheaper than Amazon. Without further waiting, I placed order. It will take 5-7 business days for the shipping. I will write one review after I receive it.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>From Google Analytic report of my blog,  I saw there are two visitors, one from Germany and the other from US. Both of them viewed my blog post about <a href="http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/01/08/setup-acer-c720-chromebook-as-development-computer/">setup C720 development environment</a>.  But in that post, I didn&rsquo;t record down step by step how to setup the development environment. Since people are interested in this topic, I think I should write a formal and detail post about this. So, here come this step by step guide of turn your C720 as development machine by install Ubuntu using <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">crouton</a>.</p>

<p>The reason I choose <code>crouton</code> over <code>chrubuntu</code> is because of the super convenient way to switch between ChromeOS and Ubuntu with <code>Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Back</code> keys. There is no need to reboot machine to switch between the OSs.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Enable Developer Mode</h4>

<p>Enable the developer mode will wipe all your data, so backup any important data before enable developer mode.</p>

<p>To enable developer mode:</p>

<ul>
<li>Press <code>Esc + Refresh (F3)</code> keys then press <code>Power</code> button</li>
<li>Press <code>Ctrl + D</code>, ignore the warning/error message on screen.</li>
<li>Press <code>Ctrl + D</code> again, you entered the developer mode.</li>
</ul>


<p>After enable developer mode, evertime you cold start your computer, you need to press <code>Ctr + D</code> or just wait for 30 second.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Install Ubuntu 13.10 Using crouton</h4>

<p><code>crouton</code> is a powerful script that will do all the download and installation job for you. Download latest version of <code>crouton</code> from <a href="http://goo.gl/fd3zc">http://goo.gl/fd3zc</a>. For details of crouton usage, refer to it&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">github repo</a>.</p>

<p>I use <code>crouton</code> to install Ubuntu 13.10, and I choose <code>xfce4</code> as the windows manager. Below are the steps I prerformed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download <code>crouton</code></li>
<li>Open shell by <code>Ctrl + Alt + T</code>, then type <code>shell</code></li>
<li>Run <code>sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -r saucy -t xfce</code>. This will start the downloading and installation process for Ubuntu 13.10</li>
<li>Wait untill the installation done.</li>
<li>Run <code>sudo startxfce4</code> to start the <code>Xfce</code></li>
<li>Anytime you want to switch between ChromeOs and Ubuntu, just use <code>Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Back</code> or <code>Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Forward</code></li>
<li>log out <code>xfce</code> will end the <code>xfce</code> session</li>
</ul>


<h4>Step 3: Install Development Tools</h4>

<p>There is no much to talk about this step, it&rsquo;s the same as install development tools in Ubuntu. Just run <code>sudo apt-get update</code>, <code>sudo apt-get install</code> to install whatever tools you needed.</p>

<p>For me, I installed <code>git</code>, <code>vim</code>, <code>build_essential</code>, <code>cmake</code>, <code>golang1.2</code>, <code>llvm3.4</code>, <code>the_silver_searcher</code> as well as <code>ruby</code> and necessory packages for <code>Octopress</code>.</p>

<p>If you followed all the steps above, your C720 will become a nice Linux development machine. I haven&rsquo;t tried to run any IDE like <code>eclipse</code> or <code>android studio</code>, I think my 2GB RAM may not sufficient for RAM hunger tools like that. If you have the 4GB version of C720, I think there is no problem to run those IDEs.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Key Map Modification (Optional)</h4>

<p>If you are like me, always use <code>CapLock</code> as <code>Ctrl</code>, you can follow the instruction in my another <a href="http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/01/15/map-search-key-to-control-key-on-acer-c720-chromebook/">post</a> to map the search key to ctrl.</p>

<p><strong>Next</strong>, I will write another post to talk about development on C720 using cloud based development environment. If you are interested, please stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Long time ago, I was thinking to build something using Google App Engine. But I didn&rsquo;t start coding after created the app in GAE. So the apps remain there with a <code>None Deployed</code> status.</p>

<p>Yesterday I downloaded the GAE Golang SDK, the reason for choosing experimental golang SDK is that, I want to be more familar with Golang though the process of GAE development.</p>

<p>So the process started with the the <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/gettingstarted/helloworld"><code>Hello World</code></a> example. I created the folder and files, then when I issue <code>goapp serve</code> command, I saw error about the <code>app.yaml</code> file. It&rsquo;s because the indent of line</p>

<pre><code>- url: /.*
</code></pre>

<p>After corrected the indent problem, the server started successfully. I need to mention that I ssh remote login my Ubuntu server to do the development. So after the <code>HelloWorld</code> app server started, I tested on my laptop with <code>http://1.2.3.4:8080</code> (assume my Ubuntu server IP is <code>1.2.3.4</code>). Chrome reported page can&rsquo;t found. That&rsquo;s strange, there is no error message from GAE, but there must be something wrong.</p>

<p>So I use <code>goapp help serve</code>, then I found there is a <code>--host=</code> option, then I tried to set the host to ip <code>1.2.3.4</code>, bingo, I saw <code>hello world!</code>.</p>

<p>After that I still wondering why I can&rsquo;t access the server using IP if I didn&rsquo;t append the <code>--host=</code> options. Then I found someone asked the same question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7534967/is-there-any-way-to-access-gae-dev-app-server-in-the-local-network">StackOverflow</a> in Year 2011. I confirmed the answer of <code>--host=0.0.0.0</code> works same as <code>--host=1.2.3.4</code>.</p>

<p>Next step I will finish the app I should finish long time ago.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I read someone&rsquo;s article about how the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081298160X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=081298160X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zhuyong.me-20">&ldquo;The Power Of Habit&rdquo;</a> changed his life in the past one year. After read the article, I was thinking that maybe I should read it also. Long time ago, I already bought the kindle edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455892823/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1455892823&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zhuyong.me-20">&ldquo;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change&rdquo;</a> from Amazon, but I didn&rsquo;t actually finished it. Both of the two books are very good book about self improvement; both of them have excellent customer reviews from thousands of customers on Amazon.</p>

<p>So after dinner when I carried my son to national library to return his books, I searched the library catalogs. Although the records shown that both the book and the audio CDs are available, I only managed to find the audio CDs at the end. That&rsquo;s good enough.</p>

<p>At the beginning of <code>The Power Of Habit</code> book, the author mentioned that people will change when they focus on one particular change for long time and that change could be the keystone habit; this keystone habit will radially change other habits. This perspective is interesting, and I totally agree on that.</p>

<p>By the time I decided to start my new blog in pure English on Github Pages, I haven&rsquo;t read this book yet, but I think my initiative goal was to make achievement through the process of writing blog. By written purely in English, I can improve my English; by written some technique stuff, I would and can learn some new tech or programming skills; by written blog, attract some audiences, build my reputation. :)</p>

<p>So far, almost one month passed since I seriously start blogging using Octpress on Github page, I did gain something. First, very obversious, my skills with git and Markdown improved a lot; second, I knew more about Chromebook. I didn&rsquo;t tried Chromebook before, even as virtual machine. But after use Chromebook for few days, I feel I love it.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s tough to keep updating blog, I was afraid I will quit somedays later. That&rsquo;s why I named my blog <code>Be Persistent, Be Patient</code> to encourage myself. So here today, this article mark as the beginning my book reading on <code>The Power Of Habits</code> and <code>The 7 Habits</code> is my next book to read. This is my short term goal for life change, and this time, I will finish them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just sold my very old desktop computer bought in 2003 to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karung_guni">Karung Guni</a> for S$2. It&rsquo;s a Pentium 4 computer I assembled by myself when I studied my 3rd year in university after my even old desktop bought in 1999 stopped working.</p>

<p>This 11 years old computer is till functional, unbelievable hah! I can&rsquo;t remember in which year I retired this computer, maybe 2007 or 2008. Since then, it was my father-in-law&rsquo;s computer during the time he occasionally visit Singapore. He uses it primarily for online novel reading. This old computer is still sufficient for his tasks.</p>

<p>The old computer still works, but too noisy, and occupy large space. So one month ago, I bought him a 2nd hand T410 laptop.</p>

<p>After I erased the whole hard disk, I was waiting for Karung Guni to come to my door at weekend. And finally, this afternoon, one uncle came, and his best offer was S$2. I just want to get rid of it, so I took the offer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I read an article <a href="http://arjunsreedharan.org/post/71403510912/c-language-and-the-linux-macro-proof-that-linux-is">C language and the linux macro &ndash; proof that linux is always Number 1</a>. It shows a simple C code which just define variable <code>linux</code> and assign with a value, but <code>gcc</code> produce error when compile it.</p>

<p>Code of the simple program:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int linux = 701;
    printf("%d", linux);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Error message from <code>gcc</code> :</p>

<pre><code>code.c: In function ‘main’:
code.c:4:6: error: expected identifier or ‘(’ before numeric constant
int linux = 701;
    ^
</code></pre>

<p>If preprocess the program using <code>gcc -E code.c</code>, the output programe code is:</p>

<pre><code>int main() {
    int 1 = 701;
    printf("%d\n", 1);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s very obvious that <code>linux</code> is <code>#define</code> somewhere with value <code>1</code>. But the code only included <code>stdio.h</code> file and there is no such define in this header file. After search Google, I have found the explanantion from stackoverflow.</p>

<p>Word such as <code>unix</code> or <code>vax</code> was defined in the pre-ANSI days to detect the system at compile time. To make the compile process pass, just pass parameter <code>-std=c89</code> or <code>-std=c99</code> to <code>gcc</code> will do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I was thinking to create a favicon for this octopress blog. Just now, after lunch, I spent some time search on google and finally created my own favicon.</p>

<p>My first idea was to create a icon using my own face cropped from picture, but the result of 16x16 pixel image was just too small to hold the details. Then I decided to go a simple wway, do a favicon just with text <code>zy</code>. Then I come cross this website called <a href="http://faviconist.com">faviconist</a>. This website make the process to create text favicon so easy. I set the background color same as <code>base03</code> in the famous <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">solarized color theme</a>, the
text color to <code>#CCCCCC</code>, and the font I chose bold <code>Redressed</code>.</p>

<p>Below is the screen when I created my favicon.</p>
