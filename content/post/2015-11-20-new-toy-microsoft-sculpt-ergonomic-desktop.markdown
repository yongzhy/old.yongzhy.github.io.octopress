This afternoon received my new toy: the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop set. 

{{< figure src="/images/blogimg/2015-11-20-Keyboard/microsoft.jpg" title="microsoft sculpt ergonomic desktop" >}}

After using old IBM Model M keyboard for long time, it took me a while to get used to this new layout and feeling. Comparing to IBM Model M, the key travel distance is really short. This keyboard would be perfect if it's mechanical switch keyboard. :) ( Yeah, the price might double as well ).

The bad thing for this keyboard is the very strong plastic odor, it made me sick only after one hour usage. Hope the smell will disappear when I return to office next Monday.
