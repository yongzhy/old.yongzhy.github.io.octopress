Yesterday was the 2nd round of COE bid in Nov, thanks to the good sale result in 7 - 8 Nov car show @ Singpaore Expo, dealer were willing to bid COE at higher price. At around 3pm, the price was already exceed 4th Nov final price. 

I kept refreshing the web page to get the status. C & C put reserve price of S$59999 at 10:30am, then at around 3:50pm when the price going to hit S$59000, they revised the bid to S$60999, then I know I guaranteed to get one COE this time. 

After COE,  C & C still need few days to settle :

0. I need to pay the remainning of down payment,
1. Settle loan from bank
2. Settle car insurance, I must say, the insurance premium is super high for new driver like me. Too bad I must take the appointed insurance from AIG. 
3. Install the front & rear camera, solar film and etc
4. Register the car under my name

Then, they will call me to collect the car. :)

Can't wait for the day to come!
