After [received my Chromecast](http://10.36.134.34:4000/blog/2014/01/25/i-received-my-chromecast/) for 10 days, I received good news from Google. Google finally [opened chromecast SDK to all developers](http://chrome.blogspot.sg/2014/02/chromecast-is-now-open-to-developers.html). This is what Chromecast users and developers waiting for long time. Developers now must be busy coding to integrate the SDK into their apps, so countless Chromecast-compatible apps would show-up any day now. 

Media player apps will be the first batch to support Chromecast, especially for local media streaming. I think this is the most desired feature for most of Chromecast users including me. I use MX Player a lot, I can't wait to see it with Chromecast support.

I don't play games on phone, but I think there will be plenty of games with Chromecast support. People likes to play games on large screen, supporting for Chromecast would be a must have feature for any android games from now on.
