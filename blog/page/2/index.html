  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today is last day of 2014. I will use this 2014 last blog to write about the utility I recently developed.</p>

<p>On my latest project, firmware code failed during test with power cycle on target. And the Lauterbach emulator can&rsquo;t detect the <code>power on</code> event on this target, so we can&rsquo;t use the <code>power on</code> event to automate initial script running. The failure only happens after power cycle, so I must let Trace32 run the setup script to enable the trace in order to capture the code running history.</p>

<p>Because previously I already did a utility to automate failure replay using Trace32 simulation, I know Trace32 has remote API to control the script running. So I come out with the idea to detect target power cycle from the message on serial port (target firmware will print some message on serial port), upon power cycle event happen, use remote API to command Trace32 to execute the setup script.</p>

<p>QT already has the <code>The Simple Terminal</code> example, so my development leverage on this example code and added Trace32 remote API code.</p>

<p>This is the image of the main window for the final working product.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s end of Year 2014 and it&rsquo;s the time to write summary for this year. Year 2014 is just an ordinary year same as previous few years, the main reason is there were no much excited things happen. There were several good opportunities for me to change, but unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t prepare myself well and I missed all those opportunities. I really think developer should be already be ready for opportunities, you never know when will an opportunity appears.</p>

<p>Anyway, to summarize my Year 2014, I grouped those things that worth mention here into few categories:</p>

<h3>Big Change</h3>

<p>There is only one thing can fit this category in 2014. On 31 July, I received email from HDB to inform us that we got queue No. 1 in HDB May 2014 sale of balance flats exercise. So I chose a new HDB 5 room flat from Costa Ris @ Pasir Ris, the location is good, very near to MRT station. My current flat location is also very good, 5 minutes walking distance to Boon Lay MRT, we decided to move to east side for better air quality and more places for kids to play. In the past two months, I was busy with new flat renovation. Every weekend I travel from very west of Singapore to very east of Singapore to monitor the renovation progress. The renovation is still in progress and we plan to move in after Chinese New Year 2015.</p>

<h3>Gadgets Bought In Year 2014</h3>

<ul>
<li>Acer C720 ChromeBook : I have install Ubuntu on this Chromebook through crouton, for the whole year, this notebook was my main computer. I use ChromeOS to surf web and use Ubuntu to do development and blog writing. I really love this machine.</li>
<li>Chromecast from Google : Mainly used to play videos from YouTube for my kids.</li>
<li>Allure Eyewear: Call Of Duty Ghost : No use much after few months</li>
<li>HHKB Pro 2 Type-S : To me, the key feeling not so good as my old IBM Model S</li>
<li>LG G Pro 2 : Good Phablet, nice battery life</li>
<li>SandDisk Extreme Pro 480GB SSD : Good deal from Amazon and very good performance</li>
</ul>


<h3>Continuous / Ongoing Efforts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Answered some StackOverflow questions and earned few hundreds reputation points.</li>
<li>Bought a domain and start writing blog on GitHub page. The first blog post was on 11 Dec 2013 and total of 34 blog posts have been published. From <code>Google Analytics</code> report, now the blog has 800 page view per month, the number is not much, but I am glad that some of the posts did helped the readers.</li>
<li>Use <code>Google Keep</code> as my daily <code>ToDoList</code> since 21 Jan 2014, so far it works well for my needs. Every morning I create a new task list with the date in title, then copy previous day&rsquo;s incomplete task to this new list, and also add new tasks. Tasks may not be completed in sequence, or been listed for quite few days, but it&rsquo;s OK, as long as I know there is this task need to be done.</li>
<li>Use <code>Google Calendar</code> as my diary to record my two boys&#8217; remarkable event since 06 Dec 2013. I create one calendar for each boy, then share the calendars to my wife, both of us tried to update the calendars daily, so we won&rsquo;t miss any valuable moment with the two boys.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My HHKB palm rest from Taobao arrived last Saturday, and I brought it to office on Monday. After use if for two days, I am totally satisfied with it. The build quality is good, size is just nice for HHKB, well polished, and no strange smell. The logo was customized very good, exactly same as my requirement.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I received my Sandisk Extreme Pro 480GB SSD on 17 Dec, on that night, immediately after my kids slept, I went to study room and replaced the internal Toshiba SATA II HDD to this SSD. Next I partitioned the drive and installed Windows 7 Ultimate, the waiting time for Windows booting was significantly reduced.</p>

<p>Next on 18 Dec night, after I installed all drivers for Windows 7, I tried to install a Debian 7.7 system to another partition to make the computer dual boot. But I failed on first try, because non-free firmware required for the WIFI hardware, but the installer can&rsquo;t load firmware from the bootable USB drive. So I prepared another USB thumbdrive dedicated for the non-free firmware on 19 Dec night, this time the installation process went smoothly and I have Debian 7.7 and Windows 7 dual booting..</p>

<p>On 20 Dec, my shopping packages from Taobao were delivered, one of those packages is the SATA adapter to replace the DVD drive, this adapter only costed my RMB 27, which is very very cheap. On that night, I took out the DVD drive and replaced it with that adapter and the original Toshiba SATA II hard drive. So now my laptop has over 1TB hard drive capacity.</p>

<p>This is the image of Sandisk Extreme Pro 480GB SSD

<p>The SATA adapter with Toshiba SATA II drive mounted
<img src="/images/blogimg/2014-12-22-ChangeDrive/toshiba.jpg"></p>

<p>SSD and SATA adapter installed on the system. The adapter doesn&rsquo;t have the hole to mount screw at location 1, and its size is smaller than the original DVD drive, so it left some part un-covered at location 2. Considering the very cheap price, I am OK with the two not perfect point.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For embedded system C projects that share same code base, one common practice is to use various feature flags to encapsulate related code. This results difficulty in code reading, especially when you have huge amounts of feature flags, especially when flags&#8217; value depend on value of other flags. This is what I am dealing with in current project. And I found <code>armcc</code> and <code>fromelf</code> have some useful feature to help developer in such situation.</p>

<p>First, <code>armcc</code>, the compiler from ARM RVCT. Command line options are <code>--debug --debug_macros -E</code>, this will generate raw C file with all preprocessors been parsed, you can see how is a macro been defined.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>--debug</code> is to enable generate debug information</li>
<li><code>--debug_macros</code> is generate debug entry for macros. You can see the expanded macro in the generated C source code. <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0491h/CIHHDEAA.html">doc here</a></li>
<li><code>-E</code> is to tell compiler not compile the C file, just excute the preprocess step. <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0491h/CIHIDBBG.html">doc here</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Second, <code>fromelf</code>, imaging you have a complicated data structure defined, of which, some elements depends on some feature flags, to find out the difference between two different configurations, instead of load into debugger and compare, you can just use <code>fromelf</code> to dump the structure and use a diff tool to compare.</p>

<p>The command line is <code>fromelf --fieldoffsets --select=the_structure.* --output=the_structure.txt final.axf</code></p>

<ul>
<li><code>--fieldoffsets</code> produce offset for each structure elements. <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0477i/BABJBGBH.html">doc here</a></li>
<li><code>--select=the_structure.*</code> to select the data structure to output</li>
<li><code>--output</code> to specify output file contain the listing</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been weeks since I purchased my LG G Pro 2, but I haven&rsquo;t insert sim card into it yet. The reason is because my current sim card is the normal size sim card, but LG G Pro 2 needs micro-sim card. I checked with my Telco M1 customer service, they said they don&rsquo;t provide sim card cutting service, I must pay S$37 to get a micro-sim card. To me, this S$37 is too expensive, so I didn&rsquo;t buy from M1 and just use the new phone as a Tablet to surf net.</p>

<p>Last week during one day lunch time, I asked my coleagues where can I find sim card cutting service, one of my colleagues said he has a cutter but never used it before, so I asked him to bring the cutter to office. And he did it today, so I cut my sim card to micro-sim. With the cutter, the task was simple and easy. Attached a picture for the cutter and frame left from origin sim card.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can&rsquo;t remember when did I joined Amazon&rsquo;s affiliate program, and I can&rsquo;t remember I ever earned a single penny from this program. That&rsquo;s why I was so surprised and happy when I found out that I have earned over US$50 from Amazon during the Black Friday week. After checked Amazon&rsquo;s report, I know all those links were not from my blog, those are from the links I posted on Facebook and one online forum after I purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHRYRLY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00KHRYRLY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zhuyong.me-20&amp;linkId=5VFWEDLJIRJOG7TM">SanDisk Extreme Pro 480GB SSD</a>. I shared the deal because I think it was a good deal, now I regret I didn&rsquo;t post to more forums. :)</p>

<p>From Amazon earning report page, I can trace back history up to few years, and I noticed that there are 5 clicks from this blog for Q1 2014, 2 clicks for Q2 2014 and 10 clicks for Q3 2014. None of the 17 clicks was converted to success purchase. I know this time I earn this US$50 is because of the shopping season, I don&rsquo;t know when could I make the second US$50 from Amazon.</p>

<p>To remember this little surprise, I have captured my Q4 earning to date.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon, I ordered another gadget from Amazon:
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHRYRLY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00KHRYRLY&linkCode=as2&tag=zhuyong.me-20&linkId=5VFWEDLJIRJOG7TM">SanDisk Extreme PRO 480GB SATA 6.0GB/s 2.5-Inch 7mm Height Solid State Drive (SSD) With 10-Year Warranty- SDSSDXPS-480G-G25</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=zhuyong.me-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00KHRYRLY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<p>When I start sourcing good SSD deal on Amazon, I was initially looking at Intel 730 480GB, few days back, it was on discount price of US$199.99. Intel SSD has 5 Years international warranty, then I found this SandDisk SSD was selling with 10 Years warranty, someone online said the warranty was international, but I can&rsquo;t find clear statement. So I contacted Amazon customer service, after confirmed the warranty is international, I asked the customer service can Amazon match the price with other online store. At the time I contact customer service, this 480GB SSD was listed around US$250, the other online store has discount of US$204. The customer service told me Amazon won&rsquo;t honor any price match. So I think I&rsquo;d better wait till Friday to see if got big discount. Then to my surprise, 3 minutes later, when I refresh the page, Amazon changed the price to US$204. So I immediately placed the order, and 2 of my colleagues also placed order on this same item.</p>

<p>This month for me is really a crazy shopping month. I have spend a lot on several different online stores:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ordered over S$2000 products from TaoBao, most of the items are for my new BTO HDB house renovation. Some package has not been shipped. I think all those items can only be delivered to my new house around end of Dec.</li>
<li>Ordered HHKB from Amazon Japan</li>
<li>Ordered LG G Pro 2 at Singapore</li>
<li>Ordered new house kitchen sink tap from Amazon. My purchase was US$206, when 25 Nov I received the product, I found Amazon has dropped the price to US$158, so I contacted customer service to refund the price difference. They granted the refund on the spot.</li>
<li>Ordered this SanDisk 480GB SSD</li>
<li>Ordered XiaoMi Power Bank, still on the way</li>
<li>Ordered backup battery for my old LG HD 4x from Aliexpress. Still on the way</li>
</ul>


<p>Ordered so many items, spending so much in one month just for online shopping. I never done this before, so worth mark it here. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My HHKB Pro 2 Type-S was delivered to my house on 19 Nov, so till today, I have officially owned it one week. So I think it&rsquo;s time to write down my feeling about this well designed keyboard.</p>

<p>Before I purchase HHKB, I have being using old IBM Model M SSK for two years, the feel for IBM Model M is superb, it&rsquo;s just too noisy. I should say sorry to colleagues whose seats near me. My work platform is Windows, and I use  Total Commander as my primary file manager. So my short review for HHKB would based on my daily usage scenario, with comparison to Model M.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Size, the super compact size, I love it</li>
<li>Key layout, for people use Emacs and VIM as their editor. Now on every computer I own, I will map <code>Caps Lock</code> to <code>Ctrl</code>, I just feel it&rsquo;s so convenient compare to <code>Ctrl</code> at left bottom corner.</li>
<li>Quite, compare to my old IBM Model M, it&rsquo;s so quite.</li>
<li>USB Hub, I put my Logitech Performance MX receiver on one of the two USB port.</li>
<li>Configurable, and have <code>Windows</code> key, of course, this is advantage compare to old Model M.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
<li>USB cable location. If the USB was at left or right side of HHKB, it could be much better.</li>
<li>No dedicated function key, and arrow key, not convenient for Windows user with Total Commander like me.</li>
<li>Key press feeling not good as IBM Model M, no &lsquo;Click&rsquo; feeling</li>
<li>Key layout, unless you have HHKB connected to all your desktop / laptop, you will keep press <code>\</code> on computer without HHKB.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a picture of my two beloved keyboards.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Same as many programmers using Emaces or VIM, I want to own a HHKB professional for real long time, and for the same reason not many people buy it: the price. This keyboard is really expensive when compare to other mechanical keyboard. But deep in my heart, I always want to own one. So this month when I want to replace my IBM model M SSK from workplace, I decided to buy a HHKB Professional 2 Type-s. Japanese Yen has being drop for a long period, so I think it&rsquo;s a good time to buy products from Japan.</p>

<p>I decided to buy from Japan <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B008GXT6SK?ref_=pe_492632_169829912_TE_M3T1_dp_1">Amazon</a>, then use <a href="http://www.jshoppers.com/forward/">JShoppers</a> to forward the package to Singapore. The process is straight forward. The reason I choose JShoppers is because of its cheaper price. The whole process is same as all other forwarding service company:</p>

<ol>
<li>Register at JShopers, you will get a unique shipping address.</li>
<li>Shopping on Amazon, shipping address use the address provided by JShoppers.</li>
<li>Wait for package to be delivered to JShoppers and they will send you an email to ask you to pay the forwarding fee.</li>
<li>Pay forwarding fee.</li>
<li>Wait for your package to be delivered to your door.</li>
</ol>


<p>My experience with JShopper this time was not very good, mainly because of the verification process. Only after my HHKB was shipped by Amazon then I realized JShoppers requires ID verification. But they didn&rsquo;t mention this in the registration page and the email after registration. Somehow, my account password was sent in plain text in the email. Which makes me think they store customers&#8217; password in plain text in database. This is a really bad practice, and I did express my concern about their online system security and possible leakage of my private information (including the uploaded verification document). Customer support told me I can upload verification documents with some parts covered, only name, date of birth and address must be shown, but the ID verification department rejected my uploaded document. So I forwarded the email from customer support to the ID verification department, then they passed my ID verification. Funny! There is one more detail make me more concern about my private information. The first email from the ID verification department was written in Simplified Chinese to inform me about failed verification, this make me think JShoppers outsourced the ID verification to China company. Anyway, I wrote so much, just to say JShoppers is not doing good to make customers feel safe about their private information.</p>

<p>The waiting time for this forward service is long, because they are seeing large amount of package recently. My packaged delivered to JShoppers on 10 Nov, only been processed on 15 Nov, and notify me to pay forwarding fee on 17 Nov, after that, the speed was fast: shipment was on 18 Nov and delivered to me on 19 Nov.</p>

<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s forget about JShoppers, here comes the exciting part, the HHKB. Amazon use a big box for the relatively small keyboard.

<p>I will write another blog later about how I feel it.</p>
