    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I read someone&rsquo;s article about how the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081298160X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=081298160X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zhuyong.me-20">&ldquo;The Power Of Habit&rdquo;</a> changed his life in the past one year. After read the article, I was thinking that maybe I should read it also. Long time ago, I already bought the kindle edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455892823/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1455892823&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zhuyong.me-20">&ldquo;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change&rdquo;</a> from Amazon, but I didn&rsquo;t actually finished it. Both of the two books are very good book about self improvement; both of them have excellent customer reviews from thousands of customers on Amazon.</p>

<p>So after dinner when I carried my son to national library to return his books, I searched the library catalogs. Although the records shown that both the book and the audio CDs are available, I only managed to find the audio CDs at the end. That&rsquo;s good enough.</p>

<p>At the beginning of <code>The Power Of Habit</code> book, the author mentioned that people will change when they focus on one particular change for long time and that change could be the keystone habit; this keystone habit will radially change other habits. This perspective is interesting, and I totally agree on that.</p>

<p>By the time I decided to start my new blog in pure English on Github Pages, I haven&rsquo;t read this book yet, but I think my initiative goal was to make achievement through the process of writing blog. By written purely in English, I can improve my English; by written some technique stuff, I would and can learn some new tech or programming skills; by written blog, attract some audiences, build my reputation. :)</p>

<p>So far, almost one month passed since I seriously start blogging using Octpress on Github page, I did gain something. First, very obversious, my skills with git and Markdown improved a lot; second, I knew more about Chromebook. I didn&rsquo;t tried Chromebook before, even as virtual machine. But after use Chromebook for few days, I feel I love it.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s tough to keep updating blog, I was afraid I will quit somedays later. That&rsquo;s why I named my blog <code>Be Persistent, Be Patient</code> to encourage myself. So here today, this article mark as the beginning my book reading on <code>The Power Of Habits</code> and <code>The 7 Habits</code> is my next book to read. This is my short term goal for life change, and this time, I will finish them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just sold my very old desktop computer bought in 2003 to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karung_guni">Karung Guni</a> for S$2. It&rsquo;s a Pentium 4 computer I assembled by myself when I studied my 3rd year in university after my even old desktop bought in 1999 stopped working.</p>

<p>This 11 years old computer is till functional, unbelievable hah! I can&rsquo;t remember in which year I retired this computer, maybe 2007 or 2008. Since then, it was my father-in-law&rsquo;s computer during the time he occasionally visit Singapore. He uses it primarily for online novel reading. This old computer is still sufficient for his tasks.</p>

<p>The old computer still works, but too noisy, and occupy large space. So one month ago, I bought him a 2nd hand T410 laptop.</p>

<p>After I erased the whole hard disk, I was waiting for Karung Guni to come to my door at weekend. And finally, this afternoon, one uncle came, and his best offer was S$2. I just want to get rid of it, so I took the offer.</p>
