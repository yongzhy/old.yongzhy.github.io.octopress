    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just sold my very old desktop computer bought in 2003 to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karung_guni">Karung Guni</a> for S$2. It&rsquo;s a Pentium 4 computer I assembled by myself when I studied my 3rd year in university after my even old desktop bought in 1999 stopped working.</p>

<p>This 11 years old computer is till functional, unbelievable hah! I can&rsquo;t remember in which year I retired this computer, maybe 2007 or 2008. Since then, it was my father-in-law&rsquo;s computer during the time he occasionally visit Singapore. He uses it primarily for online novel reading. This old computer is still sufficient for his tasks.</p>

<p>The old computer still works, but too noisy, and occupy large space. So one month ago, I bought him a 2nd hand T410 laptop.</p>

<p>After I erased the whole hard disk, I was waiting for Karung Guni to come to my door at weekend. And finally, this afternoon, one uncle came, and his best offer was S$2. I just want to get rid of it, so I took the offer.</p>
