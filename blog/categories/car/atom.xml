    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s Black Friday today, and this morning I collected my 2015 biggest shopping item : my Citroen Grand C4 Picasso. Oh Yeah!</p>

<p>At early morning, I arrived at C&amp;C and the whole process took around 1+ hour because my rear number plate installation was loose, called the technician to fix it.</p>

<p>After drove to company, I spent long time to lock the car, no mater I lock use the remote key or use physical key, I only hear the click sound but it was not locked. After tried open &amp; close all doors few times without effect. I suddenly realized that it might because of the extra remote key in my bag, which was in the car. After I took out the other key and tried lock again, it worked! I checked with other Citroen drivers, there are quite some people had same experience.</p>

<p>At afternoon after drove home, my wife and I lead our two boys to the new car, they immediately love it and enjoyed the short ride around our neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The only big problem is that I need to improve my parking skills. :(</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was the 2nd round of COE bid in Nov, thanks to the good sale result in 7 &ndash; 8 Nov car show @ Singpaore Expo, dealer were willing to bid COE at higher price. At around 3pm, the price was already exceed 4th Nov final price.</p>

<p>I kept refreshing the web page to get the status. C &amp; C put reserve price of S$59999 at 10:30am, then at around 3:50pm when the price going to hit S$59000, they revised the bid to S$60999, then I know I guaranteed to get one COE this time.</p>

<p>After COE,  C &amp; C still need few days to settle :</p>

<ol>
<li>I need to pay the remainning of down payment,</li>
<li>Settle loan from bank</li>
<li>Settle car insurance, I must say, the insurance premium is super high for new driver like me. Too bad I must take the appointed insurance from AIG.</li>
<li>Install the front &amp; rear camera, solar film and etc</li>
<li>Register the car under my name</li>
</ol>


<p>Then, they will call me to collect the car. :)</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for the day to come!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend, just after I received my official driving license, I ordered my first car &ndash; Citroen Grand C4 Picasso.</p>

<p>The reasons I chose Grand C4 Picasso are simple:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I need MPV car, we have 6 family members, 5 seaters car not enough.</p></li>
<li><p>For MPV, I shortlisted Honda Stream, Toyota Wish and this Grand C4 Picasso. In Singapore Honda and Toyota cars are people&rsquo;s Number 1 choice because the high reliability and relatively low maintenance cost. If the car dealer still carry Honda Stream, I might go for that car. As for Toyota Wish, it&rsquo;s a quite old model, no change since 2009. As for Grand C4 Picasso, this is a new model, fuel efficient, and the dealer provide 5 years warranty + 5 years free service. Most importantly, I like both the interior and exterior of this car.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now I just need to wait for the AD to bid the COE, settle car loan and insurance, then I can collect my car. Sadly, that&rsquo;s at least 2-3 weeks waiting time.</p>
