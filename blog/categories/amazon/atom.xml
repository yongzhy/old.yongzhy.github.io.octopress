    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can&rsquo;t remember when did I joined Amazon&rsquo;s affiliate program, and I can&rsquo;t remember I ever earned a single penny from this program. That&rsquo;s why I was so surprised and happy when I found out that I have earned over US$50 from Amazon during the Black Friday week. After checked Amazon&rsquo;s report, I know all those links were not from my blog, those are from the links I posted on Facebook and one online forum after I purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHRYRLY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00KHRYRLY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zhuyong.me-20&amp;linkId=5VFWEDLJIRJOG7TM">SanDisk Extreme Pro 480GB SSD</a>. I shared the deal because I think it was a good deal, now I regret I didn&rsquo;t post to more forums. :)</p>

<p>From Amazon earning report page, I can trace back history up to few years, and I noticed that there are 5 clicks from this blog for Q1 2014, 2 clicks for Q2 2014 and 10 clicks for Q3 2014. None of the 17 clicks was converted to success purchase. I know this time I earn this US$50 is because of the shopping season, I don&rsquo;t know when could I make the second US$50 from Amazon.</p>

<p>To remember this little surprise, I have captured my Q4 earning to date.</p>
