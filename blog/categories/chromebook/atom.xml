    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am a vim user, and for all my home and office computers, I map the CapLock key to Ctrl key. So after installed Ubuntu 13.10 using crouton on my new Acer C720 Chromebook, I was thinking to map the search key to control key. I did some search online as well as some experiments and finally found the solution.</p>

<p>I choosed xfce4 as my window manager because of the rather low 2GB RAM. By default, the search key is mapped to Super_L after install Ubuntu using crouton. If you want to know the keycode for each key on the keyboard, you can use <code>xev</code> to check.</p>

<p>I use <code>xmodmap</code> to do the key mapping.</p>

<p>First, create file <code>.Xmodmap</code> at your <code>$HOME</code> directory with content below</p>

<pre><code>clear control
clear mod4
keycode 133 = Super_L
add control  = Control_L Control_R Super_L
add mod4 = Hyper_L Super_R
</code></pre>

<p>Next, need to make sure <code>xmodmap</code> load <code>~/.Xmodmap</code> file when you start you linux using <code>sudo startxfce4</code> in chromebook terminal. Create file <code>~/.xinitrc</code> with content below</p>

<pre><code>if [-s ~/.Xmodmap]; then
    xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Last step is to logout your xfce environment and restart it from chromebook terminal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is my second day with Acer C720 chromebook. After two days usage, my impression on chromebook is totally impressive. My initial intension was to buy a Macbook Pro 13 retina display. But while waiting for the Apple &ldquo;Red Friday&rdquo; discount before Chinese New Year, I was thinking again and again &ldquo;do I really need to buy a powerful Macbook Pro that cost over S$2000?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have a powerful laptop at home now, but because of its bad battery life, everytime I use it, I need to plug in the power adapter. I can only use laptop after the two kids went to sleep, and I want to use it when on the bed.  The requirement to connect to power adapter just keep me away from use that laptop. What I need is a device with very good battery life and meet the requirements below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Battery must be last at least 5-7 hours</li>
<li>Must have keyboard, one of the main task of this device is for me to write blog or code on bed before sleep.</li>
<li>Can run vim, I use it as my primary code editor</li>
<li>x86 CPU, no need to be very powerful</li>
<li>Hard disc space no hard requirement, as long as there are few GB left for me to install some development tools</li>
<li>Memory at least 4GB</li>
</ul>


<p>Acer C720 meet all requirement except the 4GB RAM, it&rsquo;s because 4GB version is out of stock on Amazon. And because of Singapore telco Starthub promotion, someone was selling cheap of C720 after they got this as free when sign broadband contract with Starhub. So I just contact one guy in a forum and offer S$300 for this 2GB version C720.</p>

<p>I got it yesterday after work. After dinner, I started the process to install Ubuntu 13.10 using crouton. The process was very smooth. Below are what I have done to setup my chromebook.</p>

<ul>
<li>enable developer mode</li>
<li>install Ubuntu 13.10 using crouton</li>
<li>install vim, git, build_essential, cmake, golang1.2, llvm3.4</li>
<li>build the_silver_searcher, YouCompletme for vim</li>
<li>install ruby and necessary setup for blog system Octopress</li>
</ul>


<p>After all of those setup, I still have over 7GB space left, that&rsquo;s far better than my expection. My overall experience on this chromebook is excellet. But if there are other choices of chrombook available, I would want a configuration with 4GB RAM, 32GB SSD. Current 2GB RAM is just not enough for serious development.</p>
