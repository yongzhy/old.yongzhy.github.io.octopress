This weekend, just after I received my official driving license, I ordered my first car - Citroen Grand C4 Picasso. 

The reasons I chose Grand C4 Picasso are simple:

1. I need MPV car, we have 6 family members, 5 seaters car not enough.

2. For MPV, I shortlisted Honda Stream, Toyota Wish and this Grand C4 Picasso. In Singapore Honda and Toyota cars are people's Number 1 choice because the high reliability and relatively low maintenance cost. If the car dealer still carry Honda Stream, I might go for that car. As for Toyota Wish, it's a quite old model, no change since 2009. As for Grand C4 Picasso, this is a new model, fuel efficient, and the dealer provide 5 years warranty + 5 years free service. Most importantly, I like both the interior and exterior of this car.

Now I just need to wait for the AD to bid the COE, settle car loan and insurance, then I can collect my car. Sadly, that's at least 2-3 weeks waiting time.
