Just before lunch time, security guard at reception desk called me to collect my parcel. Great, my 3 pieces of `Call Of Duty : Ghost` arrived. I placed order on 23 Jan and it only takes 5 days for international shipping, the speed is fast enough for a US$20 delivery. 

One minutes ago, I am still very happy for `Allure's` fast delivery, but the happiness didn't last long when I opened the box and only see two pieces of eyeware inside. I immediately opened my order online and checked carefully, yes, the invoice stated clearly that I ordered 3 pieces of eyewear, but I only got 2 of them shipped. And there is only 1 shipment number, so I guess there won't be a second package arrive. Next I immediately sent an email through the online contact form, but I think it will take some hours before I got response due to the different timezone. 

After lunch, I clipped the eyewear onto my glass and used it for the whole afternoon. So here is how I feel about this eyewear with 1 afternoon experience: 

* I felt a little giddy at first, guess is due to the .2 diopter
* It's a little bit heavy
