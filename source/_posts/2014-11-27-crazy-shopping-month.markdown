This afternoon, I ordered another gadget from Amazon: 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHRYRLY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00KHRYRLY&linkCode=as2&tag=zhuyong.me-20&linkId=5VFWEDLJIRJOG7TM">SanDisk Extreme PRO 480GB SATA 6.0GB/s 2.5-Inch 7mm Height Solid State Drive (SSD) With 10-Year Warranty- SDSSDXPS-480G-G25</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=zhuyong.me-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00KHRYRLY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

When I start sourcing good SSD deal on Amazon, I was initially looking at Intel 730 480GB, few days back, it was on discount price of US$199.99. Intel SSD has 5 Years international warranty, then I found this SandDisk SSD was selling with 10 Years warranty, someone online said the warranty was international, but I can't find clear statement. So I contacted Amazon customer service, after confirmed the warranty is international, I asked the customer service can Amazon match the price with other online store. At the time I contact customer service, this 480GB SSD was listed around US$250, the other online store has discount of US$204. The customer service told me Amazon won't honor any price match. So I think I'd better wait till Friday to see if got big discount. Then to my surprise, 3 minutes later, when I refresh the page, Amazon changed the price to US$204. So I immediately placed the order, and 2 of my colleagues also placed order on this same item.  

This month for me is really a crazy shopping month. I have spend a lot on several different online stores:

* Ordered over S$2000 products from TaoBao, most of the items are for my new BTO HDB house renovation. Some package has not been shipped. I think all those items can only be delivered to my new house around end of Dec.
* Ordered HHKB from Amazon Japan
* Ordered LG G Pro 2 at Singapore
* Ordered new house kitchen sink tap from Amazon. My purchase was US$206, when 25 Nov I received the product, I found Amazon has dropped the price to US$158, so I contacted customer service to refund the price difference. They granted the refund on the spot.
* Ordered this SanDisk 480GB SSD
* Ordered XiaoMi Power Bank, still on the way
* Ordered backup battery for my old LG HD 4x from Aliexpress. Still on the way

Ordered so many items, spending so much in one month just for online shopping. I never done this before, so worth mark it here. :)
