I haven't updated [my old blog](http://yongzhy.blogspot.com) for long time, one of the reason is because it's not easy to post a blog with code snippets on blospot. Few days back, I came by an article mentioned blogging on Github; after read through the article, I felt that's the blog engine I really want. My blog is all about programming stuff, so static pages would fulfill my requriements. Blogging on Github require some initial setup, but with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), the task becomes simple. Just follow the documents on Octopress website, you can have your personal blog on Github in few minutes.

To me, I think blogging on Github has following benefits you might also want:

* Version control with git, not only your post been version controlled, but also, you make yourself familiar with git
* Very nich code snippets sharing
* Writting in Markdown, no need to care much about formatting and stylem. Just follow Markdown syntax, and it is easy
* Unlimited space to store your contents.

Anyway, this marks my first blog on Github.
