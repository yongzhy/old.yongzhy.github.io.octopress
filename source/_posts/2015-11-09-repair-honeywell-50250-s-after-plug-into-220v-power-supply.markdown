Because of forest fire from neighbour Indonesia, air quality for 2015 Augest and September in Singapore reached hazardous level for many days. 

In all past hazardous day, it's my job to move Honeywell 50250-S air purifier around, then one day, while I was having my dinner, my wife volunteered to do the job. And that's it, she plugged the plug into 220V output from the transformer, and both the transfer and purifier burnt. As the result, we suffer the haze for long time until I repair it, and by that time, haze almost gone. 

To fix the transformer is simple, just replace the fuse. 

To fix the purifier is little bit difficult, first I can't find online anything regarding disassemble 50250-S, I can only try to disassemble any parts that can be taken out, and finally figured out where the PCB is. 

Just when I saw the PCB, I feel that I can fix it, because only one component was burnt. After search around online, I figured out that's a veristor, but there is no part number printed, bad luck. Next I took the PCB to Simlim Tower, visited different shops and asked around if they have the replacement for that veristor, luckily I found one from a shop at basement, the replacement component is 10D271K (standard veristor for 110V). By the way, the cost for two transformer fuse + one 10D271K is S$2. 

The repair process is simple, just use solder iron take out old versiter and replace with this new one, connect back the PCB, turn on the purifier,
