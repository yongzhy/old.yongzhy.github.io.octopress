Today I read someone's article about how the book ["The Power Of Habit"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081298160X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=081298160X&linkCode=as2&tag=zhuyong.me-20) changed his life in the past one year. After read the article, I was thinking that maybe I should read it also. Long time ago, I already bought the kindle edition of ["The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455892823/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1455892823&linkCode=as2&tag=zhuyong.me-20) from Amazon, but I didn't actually finished it. Both of the two books are very good book about self improvement; both of them have excellent customer reviews from thousands of customers on Amazon. 

So after dinner when I carried my son to national library to return his books, I searched the library catalogs. Although the records shown that both the book and the audio CDs are available, I only managed to find the audio CDs at the end. That's good enough.

At the beginning of `The Power Of Habit` book, the author mentioned that people will change when they focus on one particular change for long time and that change could be the keystone habit; this keystone habit will radially change other habits. This perspective is interesting, and I totally agree on that. 

By the time I decided to start my new blog in pure English on Github Pages, I haven't read this book yet, but I think my initiative goal was to make achievement through the process of writing blog. By written purely in English, I can improve my English; by written some technique stuff, I would and can learn some new tech or programming skills; by written blog, attract some audiences, build my reputation. :)

So far, almost one month passed since I seriously start blogging using Octpress on Github page, I did gain something. First, very obversious, my skills with git and Markdown improved a lot; second, I knew more about Chromebook. I didn't tried Chromebook before, even as virtual machine. But after use Chromebook for few days, I feel I love it.

I know it's tough to keep updating blog, I was afraid I will quit somedays later. That's why I named my blog `Be Persistent, Be Patient` to encourage myself. So here today, this article mark as the beginning my book reading on `The Power Of Habits` and `The 7 Habits` is my next book to read. This is my short term goal for life change, and this time, I will finish them.
