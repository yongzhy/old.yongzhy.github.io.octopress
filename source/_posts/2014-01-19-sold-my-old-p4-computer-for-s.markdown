I just sold my very old desktop computer bought in 2003 to [Karung Guni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karung_guni) for S$2. It's a Pentium 4 computer I assembled by myself when I studied my 3rd year in university after my even old desktop bought in 1999 stopped working.

This 11 years old computer is till functional, unbelievable hah! I can't remember in which year I retired this computer, maybe 2007 or 2008. Since then, it was my father-in-law's computer during the time he occasionally visit Singapore. He uses it primarily for online novel reading. This old computer is still sufficient for his tasks. 

The old computer still works, but too noisy, and occupy large space. So one month ago, I bought him a 2nd hand T410 laptop. 

After I erased the whole hard disk, I was waiting for Karung Guni to come to my door at weekend. And finally, this afternoon, one uncle came, and his best offer was S$2. I just want to get rid of it, so I took the offer.
