Last night I was thinking to create a favicon for this octopress blog. Just now, after lunch, I spent some time search on google and finally created my own favicon.

My first idea was to create a icon using my own face cropped from picture, but the result of 16x16 pixel image was just too small to hold the details. Then I decided to go a simple wway, do a favicon just with text `zy`. Then I come cross this website called [faviconist](http://faviconist.com). This website make the process to create text favicon so easy. I set the background color same as `base03` in the famous [solarized color theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized), the
text color to `#CCCCCC`, and the font I chose bold `Redressed`. 

Below is the screen when I created my favicon.
