I can't remember when did I joined Amazon's affiliate program, and I can't remember I ever earned a single penny from this program. That's why I was so surprised and happy when I found out that I have earned over US$50 from Amazon during the Black Friday week. After checked Amazon's report, I know all those links were not from my blog, those are from the links I posted on Facebook and one online forum after I purchased [SanDisk Extreme Pro 480GB SSD](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHRYRLY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00KHRYRLY&linkCode=as2&tag=zhuyong.me-20&linkId=5VFWEDLJIRJOG7TM). I shared the deal because I think it was a good deal, now I regret I didn't post to more forums. :)

From Amazon earning report page, I can trace back history up to few years, and I noticed that there are 5 clicks from this blog for Q1 2014, 2 clicks for Q2 2014 and 10 clicks for Q3 2014. None of the 17 clicks was converted to success purchase. I know this time I earn this US$50 is because of the shopping season, I don't know when could I make the second US$50 from Amazon. 

To remember this little surprise, I have captured my Q4 earning to date.
