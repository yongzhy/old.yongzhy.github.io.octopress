    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/12/29/2014-year-end-summary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s end of Year 2014 and it&rsquo;s the time to write summary for this year. Year 2014 is just an ordinary year same as previous few years, the main reason is there were no much excited things happen. There were several good opportunities for me to change, but unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t prepare myself well and I missed all those opportunities. I really think developer should be already be ready for opportunities, you never know when will an opportunity appears.</p>

<p>Anyway, to summarize my Year 2014, I grouped those things that worth mention here into few categories:</p>

<h3>Big Change</h3>

<p>There is only one thing can fit this category in 2014. On 31 July, I received email from HDB to inform us that we got queue No. 1 in HDB May 2014 sale of balance flats exercise. So I chose a new HDB 5 room flat from Costa Ris @ Pasir Ris, the location is good, very near to MRT station. My current flat location is also very good, 5 minutes walking distance to Boon Lay MRT, we decided to move to east side for better air quality and more places for kids to play. In the past two months, I was busy with new flat renovation. Every weekend I travel from very west of Singapore to very east of Singapore to monitor the renovation progress. The renovation is still in progress and we plan to move in after Chinese New Year 2015.</p>

<h3>Gadgets Bought In Year 2014</h3>

<ul>
<li>Acer C720 ChromeBook : I have install Ubuntu on this Chromebook through crouton, for the whole year, this notebook was my main computer. I use ChromeOS to surf web and use Ubuntu to do development and blog writing. I really love this machine.</li>
<li>Chromecast from Google : Mainly used to play videos from YouTube for my kids.</li>
<li>Allure Eyewear: Call Of Duty Ghost : No use much after few months</li>
<li>HHKB Pro 2 Type-S : To me, the key feeling not so good as my old IBM Model S</li>
<li>LG G Pro 2 : Good Phablet, nice battery life</li>
<li>SandDisk Extreme Pro 480GB SSD : Good deal from Amazon and very good performance</li>
</ul>


<h3>Continuous / Ongoing Efforts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Answered some StackOverflow questions and earned few hundreds reputation points.</li>
<li>Bought a domain and start writing blog on GitHub page. The first blog post was on 11 Dec 2013 and total of 34 blog posts have been published. From <code>Google Analytics</code> report, now the blog has 800 page view per month, the number is not much, but I am glad that some of the posts did helped the readers.</li>
<li>Use <code>Google Keep</code> as my daily <code>ToDoList</code> since 21 Jan 2014, so far it works well for my needs. Every morning I create a new task list with the date in title, then copy previous day&rsquo;s incomplete task to this new list, and also add new tasks. Tasks may not be completed in sequence, or been listed for quite few days, but it&rsquo;s OK, as long as I know there is this task need to be done.</li>
<li>Use <code>Google Calendar</code> as my diary to record my two boys&#8217; remarkable event since 06 Dec 2013. I create one calendar for each boy, then share the calendars to my wife, both of us tried to update the calendars daily, so we won&rsquo;t miss any valuable moment with the two boys.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My HHKB palm rest from Taobao arrived last Saturday, and I brought it to office on Monday. After use if for two days, I am totally satisfied with it. The build quality is good, size is just nice for HHKB, well polished, and no strange smell. The logo was customized very good, exactly same as my requirement.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I received my Sandisk Extreme Pro 480GB SSD on 17 Dec, on that night, immediately after my kids slept, I went to study room and replaced the internal Toshiba SATA II HDD to this SSD. Next I partitioned the drive and installed Windows 7 Ultimate, the waiting time for Windows booting was significantly reduced.</p>

<p>Next on 18 Dec night, after I installed all drivers for Windows 7, I tried to install a Debian 7.7 system to another partition to make the computer dual boot. But I failed on first try, because non-free firmware required for the WIFI hardware, but the installer can&rsquo;t load firmware from the bootable USB drive. So I prepared another USB thumbdrive dedicated for the non-free firmware on 19 Dec night, this time the installation process went smoothly and I have Debian 7.7 and Windows 7 dual booting..</p>

<p>On 20 Dec, my shopping packages from Taobao were delivered, one of those packages is the SATA adapter to replace the DVD drive, this adapter only costed my RMB 27, which is very very cheap. On that night, I took out the DVD drive and replaced it with that adapter and the original Toshiba SATA II hard drive. So now my laptop has over 1TB hard drive capacity.</p>

<p>This is the image of Sandisk Extreme Pro 480GB SSD

<p>The SATA adapter with Toshiba SATA II drive mounted

<p>SSD and SATA adapter installed on the system. The adapter doesn&rsquo;t have the hole to mount screw at location 1, and its size is smaller than the original DVD drive, so it left some part un-covered at location 2. Considering the very cheap price, I am OK with the two not perfect point.

    <link href="http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/12/12/arm-rvct-tips-armcc-and-and-fromelf/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-12T15:54:19+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/12/12/arm-rvct-tips-armcc-and-and-fromelf</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For embedded system C projects that share same code base, one common practice is to use various feature flags to encapsulate related code. This results difficulty in code reading, especially when you have huge amounts of feature flags, especially when flags&#8217; value depend on value of other flags. This is what I am dealing with in current project. And I found <code>armcc</code> and <code>fromelf</code> have some useful feature to help developer in such situation.</p>

<p>First, <code>armcc</code>, the compiler from ARM RVCT. Command line options are <code>--debug --debug_macros -E</code>, this will generate raw C file with all preprocessors been parsed, you can see how is a macro been defined.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>--debug</code> is to enable generate debug information</li>
<li><code>--debug_macros</code> is generate debug entry for macros. You can see the expanded macro in the generated C source code. <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0491h/CIHHDEAA.html">doc here</a></li>
<li><code>-E</code> is to tell compiler not compile the C file, just excute the preprocess step. <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0491h/CIHIDBBG.html">doc here</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Second, <code>fromelf</code>, imaging you have a complicated data structure defined, of which, some elements depends on some feature flags, to find out the difference between two different configurations, instead of load into debugger and compare, you can just use <code>fromelf</code> to dump the structure and use a diff tool to compare.</p>

<p>The command line is <code>fromelf --fieldoffsets --select=the_structure.* --output=the_structure.txt final.axf</code></p>

<ul>
<li><code>--fieldoffsets</code> produce offset for each structure elements. <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0477i/BABJBGBH.html">doc here</a></li>
<li><code>--select=the_structure.*</code> to select the data structure to output</li>
<li><code>--output</code> to specify output file contain the listing</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/12/08/diy-cut-my-sim-card-to-micro-sim</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been weeks since I purchased my LG G Pro 2, but I haven&rsquo;t insert sim card into it yet. The reason is because my current sim card is the normal size sim card, but LG G Pro 2 needs micro-sim card. I checked with my Telco M1 customer service, they said they don&rsquo;t provide sim card cutting service, I must pay S$37 to get a micro-sim card. To me, this S$37 is too expensive, so I didn&rsquo;t buy from M1 and just use the new phone as a Tablet to surf net.</p>

<p>Last week during one day lunch time, I asked my coleagues where can I find sim card cutting service, one of my colleagues said he has a cutter but never used it before, so I asked him to bring the cutter to office. And he did it today, so I cut my sim card to micro-sim. With the cutter, the task was simple and easy. Attached a picture for the cutter and frame left from origin sim card.</p>

    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/12/03/my-number-1-earning-report-from-amazon-affiliate</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can&rsquo;t remember when did I joined Amazon&rsquo;s affiliate program, and I can&rsquo;t remember I ever earned a single penny from this program. That&rsquo;s why I was so surprised and happy when I found out that I have earned over US$50 from Amazon during the Black Friday week. After checked Amazon&rsquo;s report, I know all those links were not from my blog, those are from the links I posted on Facebook and one online forum after I purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHRYRLY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00KHRYRLY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zhuyong.me-20&amp;linkId=5VFWEDLJIRJOG7TM">SanDisk Extreme Pro 480GB SSD</a>. I shared the deal because I think it was a good deal, now I regret I didn&rsquo;t post to more forums. :)</p>

<p>From Amazon earning report page, I can trace back history up to few years, and I noticed that there are 5 clicks from this blog for Q1 2014, 2 clicks for Q2 2014 and 10 clicks for Q3 2014. None of the 17 clicks was converted to success purchase. I know this time I earn this US$50 is because of the shopping season, I don&rsquo;t know when could I make the second US$50 from Amazon.</p>

<p>To remember this little surprise, I have captured my Q4 earning to date.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon, I ordered another gadget from Amazon:
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHRYRLY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00KHRYRLY&linkCode=as2&tag=zhuyong.me-20&linkId=5VFWEDLJIRJOG7TM">SanDisk Extreme PRO 480GB SATA 6.0GB/s 2.5-Inch 7mm Height Solid State Drive (SSD) With 10-Year Warranty- SDSSDXPS-480G-G25</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=zhuyong.me-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00KHRYRLY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<p>When I start sourcing good SSD deal on Amazon, I was initially looking at Intel 730 480GB, few days back, it was on discount price of US$199.99. Intel SSD has 5 Years international warranty, then I found this SandDisk SSD was selling with 10 Years warranty, someone online said the warranty was international, but I can&rsquo;t find clear statement. So I contacted Amazon customer service, after confirmed the warranty is international, I asked the customer service can Amazon match the price with other online store. At the time I contact customer service, this 480GB SSD was listed around US$250, the other online store has discount of US$204. The customer service told me Amazon won&rsquo;t honor any price match. So I think I&rsquo;d better wait till Friday to see if got big discount. Then to my surprise, 3 minutes later, when I refresh the page, Amazon changed the price to US$204. So I immediately placed the order, and 2 of my colleagues also placed order on this same item.</p>

<p>This month for me is really a crazy shopping month. I have spend a lot on several different online stores:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ordered over S$2000 products from TaoBao, most of the items are for my new BTO HDB house renovation. Some package has not been shipped. I think all those items can only be delivered to my new house around end of Dec.</li>
<li>Ordered HHKB from Amazon Japan</li>
<li>Ordered LG G Pro 2 at Singapore</li>
<li>Ordered new house kitchen sink tap from Amazon. My purchase was US$206, when 25 Nov I received the product, I found Amazon has dropped the price to US$158, so I contacted customer service to refund the price difference. They granted the refund on the spot.</li>
<li>Ordered this SanDisk 480GB SSD</li>
<li>Ordered XiaoMi Power Bank, still on the way</li>
<li>Ordered backup battery for my old LG HD 4x from Aliexpress. Still on the way</li>
</ul>


<p>Ordered so many items, spending so much in one month just for online shopping. I never done this before, so worth mark it here. :)</p>

    <link href="http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/11/26/hhkb-pro-2-type-s-after-one-week/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-26T14:33:34+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/11/26/hhkb-pro-2-type-s-after-one-week</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My HHKB Pro 2 Type-S was delivered to my house on 19 Nov, so till today, I have officially owned it one week. So I think it&rsquo;s time to write down my feeling about this well designed keyboard.</p>

<p>Before I purchase HHKB, I have being using old IBM Model M SSK for two years, the feel for IBM Model M is superb, it&rsquo;s just too noisy. I should say sorry to colleagues whose seats near me. My work platform is Windows, and I use  Total Commander as my primary file manager. So my short review for HHKB would based on my daily usage scenario, with comparison to Model M.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Size, the super compact size, I love it</li>
<li>Key layout, for people use Emacs and VIM as their editor. Now on every computer I own, I will map <code>Caps Lock</code> to <code>Ctrl</code>, I just feel it&rsquo;s so convenient compare to <code>Ctrl</code> at left bottom corner.</li>
<li>Quite, compare to my old IBM Model M, it&rsquo;s so quite.</li>
<li>USB Hub, I put my Logitech Performance MX receiver on one of the two USB port.</li>
<li>Configurable, and have <code>Windows</code> key, of course, this is advantage compare to old Model M.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
<li>USB cable location. If the USB was at left or right side of HHKB, it could be much better.</li>
<li>No dedicated function key, and arrow key, not convenient for Windows user with Total Commander like me.</li>
<li>Key press feeling not good as IBM Model M, no &lsquo;Click&rsquo; feeling</li>
<li>Key layout, unless you have HHKB connected to all your desktop / laptop, you will keep press <code>\</code> on computer without HHKB.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a picture of my two beloved keyboards.</p>

    <link href="http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/11/25/finally-hhkb-professional-type-s/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-25T08:49:10+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/11/25/finally-hhkb-professional-type-s</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Same as many programmers using Emaces or VIM, I want to own a HHKB professional for real long time, and for the same reason not many people buy it: the price. This keyboard is really expensive when compare to other mechanical keyboard. But deep in my heart, I always want to own one. So this month when I want to replace my IBM model M SSK from workplace, I decided to buy a HHKB Professional 2 Type-s. Japanese Yen has being drop for a long period, so I think it&rsquo;s a good time to buy products from Japan.</p>

<p>I decided to buy from Japan <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B008GXT6SK?ref_=pe_492632_169829912_TE_M3T1_dp_1">Amazon</a>, then use <a href="http://www.jshoppers.com/forward/">JShoppers</a> to forward the package to Singapore. The process is straight forward. The reason I choose JShoppers is because of its cheaper price. The whole process is same as all other forwarding service company:</p>

<ol>
<li>Register at JShopers, you will get a unique shipping address.</li>
<li>Shopping on Amazon, shipping address use the address provided by JShoppers.</li>
<li>Wait for package to be delivered to JShoppers and they will send you an email to ask you to pay the forwarding fee.</li>
<li>Pay forwarding fee.</li>
<li>Wait for your package to be delivered to your door.</li>
</ol>


<p>My experience with JShopper this time was not very good, mainly because of the verification process. Only after my HHKB was shipped by Amazon then I realized JShoppers requires ID verification. But they didn&rsquo;t mention this in the registration page and the email after registration. Somehow, my account password was sent in plain text in the email. Which makes me think they store customers&#8217; password in plain text in database. This is a really bad practice, and I did express my concern about their online system security and possible leakage of my private information (including the uploaded verification document). Customer support told me I can upload verification documents with some parts covered, only name, date of birth and address must be shown, but the ID verification department rejected my uploaded document. So I forwarded the email from customer support to the ID verification department, then they passed my ID verification. Funny! There is one more detail make me more concern about my private information. The first email from the ID verification department was written in Simplified Chinese to inform me about failed verification, this make me think JShoppers outsourced the ID verification to China company. Anyway, I wrote so much, just to say JShoppers is not doing good to make customers feel safe about their private information.</p>

<p>The waiting time for this forward service is long, because they are seeing large amount of package recently. My packaged delivered to JShoppers on 10 Nov, only been processed on 15 Nov, and notify me to pay forwarding fee on 17 Nov, after that, the speed was fast: shipment was on 18 Nov and delivered to me on 19 Nov.</p>

<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s forget about JShoppers, here comes the exciting part, the HHKB. Amazon use a big box for the relatively small keyboard.

<p>I will write another blog later about how I feel it.</p>

From version 7.2, they added the <code>apt-get</code> like package manager: <code>MobApt Package Manager</code>, and added the option to set <code>persistent root</code> directory, so user can install their own cygwin package to this persistent root directory. This should be the most desirable feature for all personal edition users, with this feature, package upgrading and installation is within one&rsquo;s fingertips.</p>

<p>But at Version 7.2, when I tried use this <code>MobApt</code> to install <code>git</code>, after installation done, <code>git</code> command not recognized when I typed in shell. After checked the installation process, I found a lot of link to <code>git.exe</code> were not created successfully, so I manually created those links, and <code>git</code> command works, but this is a painful process.</p>

<p>Today, when I setup <code>MobaXterm</code> Vesion 7.3 on my laptop, I suddenly realized that maybe I should run <code>MobaXterm</code> as Administrator for it to create those links successfully. And when I did that, result shown that I was correct, everything installed nicely. Next, I went back to my desktop PC, the process didn&rsquo;t succeed, I think I need a fresh installation, so I deleted the whole persistent root folder and persistent home folder on my desktop PC and went through the whole process again. Bingo, <code>git</code> works like a charm. Why I didn&rsquo;t realized this when I use Version 7.2??</p>

<p>When I remove the persistent root folder in Windows 7, I say message that some file / folder can&rsquo;t be removed because of <code>Permission Denined</code>. After few seconds Google, solution is simple:</p>

<pre><code>takeown /r /f DRIVE:\PATH
icacls DRIVE:\PATH /grant USERNAME:F /T
</code></pre>

<p>To conclude, next time, I must run <code>MobaXterm</code> as Administrator to install any new package or upgrade existing packages.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/">MobaXterm</a> is a very nice portable ssh client as well as UNIX environment on Windows system. It has a lot of useful utilities including Xserver bundled into one single exe file. Recently I use it as my primary terminal on Windows system. But when I use the git plugin to clone / push my github repository, it first give me error of cert file not found, so I follow online instruction to set the root cert file in <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file to add following lines:</p>

<pre><code>[http]
    sslcainfo = c:/msysgit/mingw/bin/curl-ca-bundle.crt
</code></pre>

<p>This tells <code>git</code> to use the root cert file from <code>msysgit</code>, but next I saw new error messages:</p>

<pre><code>*   CAfile: c:/msysgit/mingw/bin/curl-ca-bundle.crt
CApath: none

***

error: The requested URL returned error: 403 Forbidden while accessing 
</code></pre>

<p>After tried with several solutions from Google search results, I found the solution provided by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">GitHub</a> solved my problem. The solution is simple, use SSH to replace the HTTPS connection. Below are the steps:</p>

<p>First, generate SSH key:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N ""
</code></pre>

<p>Next copy content from <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>, cdd public key to github account,</p>

<pre><code>$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</code></pre>

<p>Next, change the repository remote:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:yongzhy/vimconfig.git
</code></pre>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s DONE.</p>

    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/03/19/c-code-unit-testing-using-cmocka</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cmocka.org/">cmocka</a> is a unit testing framework for C, it is developed based on Google&rsquo;s project <a href="https://code.google.com/p/cmockery/">cmockery</a>. It was easy to use, and the author corrected some bugs from <code>cmockery</code>.</p>

<h3>Install cmocka</h3>

<p>First download source code for latest version of <code>cmocka</code> from <a href="https://open.cryptomilk.org/projects/cmocka/files">https://open.cryptomilk.org/projects/cmocka/files</a>. Current latest version is 0.3.2, and the source file is <code>cmocka-0.3.2.tar.xz</code>. <code>cmake</code> is required to build <code>cmocka</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/Downloads
$ xz -d cmocka-0.3.2.tar.xz
$ tar vxf cmocka-0.3.2.tar
$ cd cmocka-0.3.2
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
</code></pre>

<h3>Use cmocka</h3>

<p>Create source file with test cases. Simple example would be like:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;
#include &lt;cmocka.h&gt;
static void test(void **state)
{
    assert_int_equal(3, 3);
    assert_int_not_equal(3, 3);
}
int main(void) 
{
    const UnitTest tests[] = 
    {
        unit_test(test),
    };
    return run_tests(tests);
}
</code></pre>

<p>save file as `cmockatest.c</p>

<pre><code>$ gcc cmockatest.c -lcmocka -o cmockatest
$ ./cmockatest

[==========] Running 1 test(s).
[ RUN      ] test
3 == 3
cmocka.c:8: error: Failure!
[  FAILED  ] test
[==========] 1 test(s) run.
[  PASSED  ] 0 test(s).
[  FAILED  ] 1 test(s), listed below:
[  FAILED  ] test
</code></pre>

    <updated>2014-02-20T17:23:59+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/02/20/hack-youcompleteme-and-libclang-for-lamely-structured-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On 13 Feb 2014 I asked a question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21746668/configure-vim-youcompleteme-for-special-project-structure">StackOverflow</a> on how to configure / modify vim plugin <code>YouCompleteMe</code> to fit special project structure. I guess my project structure is really lame, after two days waiting, some comments were given, but my problem not realy addressed. So I think I have to <strong>DO IT MYSELF</strong>. Then I read the source code for <code>YouComeplteMe</code> as well as <code>libclang</code>, because I only need the code completion function, lucky the related code are not much. Then I done  experiments with different approaches, and today, finally, I had my hacking works. Then I think I should record this nice experience, that&rsquo;s the purpose of this blog post.</p>

<h3>My Question On StackOverflow</h3>

<p>My C project has following structures. This is the structure for a large project, I can&rsquo;t change the structure. I want to use YouCompleteMe for semantic code completion for this project.</p>

<pre><code>main/                     // folder for C file to be compiled
  |- module1.c            // module main C file.
  |- module2.c
  |- .....
module1/
  |- mod1_func1.c         // function file to be included in main module C file.
  |- mod1_func2.c
  |- mod2_func3.c
module2/
  |- mod2_func1.c
  |- mod2_func2.c
  |- mod2_func3.c
</code></pre>

<p>Content for <code>moduleX.c</code>, this will include all related header files and module related C files.</p>

<pre><code>#include "header1.h"
#include "header2.h"
...
#include "modX_func1.c"
#include "modX_func2.c"
</code></pre>

<p>Content for <code>modX_funcX.c</code> has one or few function definitions. Doesn&rsquo;t have header included</p>

<pre><code>// no header file included here
int modX_funcX(void) {.....}
</code></pre>

<p>Because there is not related header included, <code>clang</code> must parse <code>moduleX.c</code> in order to do code completion on <code>modX_funcX.c</code>,  I have tried <code>clang</code> code completion from command line. Command below works</p>

<pre><code>clang -cc1 -x c -fsyntax-only -code-completion-at mod1_func1.c:4:11 module1.c 
</code></pre>

<p>So my question: how to configure YouCompleteMe to do code completion when I edit the <code>modX_funcX.c</code> file?</p>

<p>I guess modification to YouCompleteMe source might required to do this job. My current idea is to add a file mapping database with format:</p>

<pre><code>path_of_file_to_complete:path_of_file_for_clang_to_parse
</code></pre>

<p>So before send the code completion request, get <code>path_of_file_for_clang_to_parse</code> from database based on current buffer name, pass this file name to <code>libclang</code>.</p>

<p>Is my idea workable? If Yes, where is exactly place to add this file mapping function?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>My Analysis</h3>

<p>To make job easy, I make a simple project structure to simulate my rare project structure.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/dev/c/clang
$ ls
a.c  a.h  b.c  b.h  c.c  c.h  main.c
</code></pre>

<p>content for <code>a.h</code></p>

<pre><code>typedef struct A {
    struct A * next;
    unsigned int data;
}A;
</code></pre>

<p>content for <code>a.c</code></p>

<pre><code>int test(void)
{
    A *list;
    list-&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>content for <code>main.c</code></p>

<pre><code>#include "a.h"
#include "b.h"
#include "c.h"

#include "a.c"
#include "b.c"
#include "c.c"
</code></pre>

<p>My ultimate goal is to let <code>YouCompleteMe</code> to do code completion when I type <code>-&gt;</code> at line 4 of file <code>a.c</code>. To test with <code>clang</code> from command line</p>

<pre><code>$ clang -cc1 -x c -fsyntax-only -code-completion-at a.c:4:11 main.c
COMPLETION: data : [#unsigned int#]data
COMPLETION: next : [#struct A *#]next
</code></pre>

<h4>Analyze clang Command Line</h4>

<p>So command line code completion works for this simulation structure. To understand why <code>clang</code> CLI works while <code>YouCompleteMe</code> doesn&rsquo;t, I need to find the difference at the point of code completetion for CLI and <code>libclang</code>. So I need a debug version of <code>clang</code>. Below are the steps to download and build debug version of <code>clang</code> version 3.3.</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir -p /data/sourcecode
$ svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/tags/RELEASE_33/final llvm3.3
$ cd llvm3.3/tools
$ svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/tags/RELEASE_33/final clang
$ cd ../projects
$ svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/tags/RELEASE_33/final compiler-rt
$ cd /data/build
$ mkdir llvm3.3-linux
$ cd llvm3.3-linux
$ /data/sourcecode/llvm3.3/configure --prefix=/data/software/C-C++/llvm3.3-hack/ CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++
$ make -j4
$ make install
</code></pre>

<p>Next step is to load debug version of <code>clang</code> with the working arguments. I want to break at function <code>ASTFrontendAction::ExecuteAction()</code> to check some variables.</p>

<pre><code>$ gdb --args /data/software/C-C++/llvm3.3-hack/bin/clang -cc1 -x c -fsyntax-only -code-completion-at a.c:4:11 main.c

(gdb) break z:\sourcecode\llvm3.3\tools\clang\lib\frontend\frontendaction.cpp:457

Breakpoint 1 at 0xd775d3: file /data/sourcecode/llvm3.3/tools/clang/lib/Frontend/FrontendAction.cpp, line 457.

(gdb) run

Starting program: /data/software/C-C++/llvm3.3-hack/bin/clang -cc1 -x c -fsyntax-only -code-completion-at a.c:4:11 main.c
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".
Breakpoint 1, clang::ASTFrontendAction::ExecuteAction (this=0x513a5d0) at /data/sourcecode/llvm3.3/tools/clang/lib/Frontend/FrontendAction.cpp:457
457       if (hasCodeCompletionSupport() &amp;&amp;

(gdb) print CI.getFrontendOpts().Inputs[0]

$3 = (clang::FrontendInputFile &amp;) @0x513b600: {File = {static npos = &lt;optimized out&gt;, _M_dataplus = {&lt;std::allocator&lt;char&gt;&gt; = {&lt;__gnu_cxx::new_allocator&lt;char&gt;&gt; = {&lt;No data fields&gt;}, &lt;No data fields&gt;}, _M_p = 0x513b5e8 "main.c"}},
Buffer = 0x0, Kind = clang::IK_C, IsSystem = false}

(gdb) print CI.getFrontendOpts().CodeCompletionAt

$4 = {FileName = {static npos = &lt;optimized out&gt;, _M_dataplus = {&lt;std::allocator&lt;char&gt;&gt; = {&lt;__gnu_cxx::new_allocator&lt;char&gt;&gt; = {&lt;No data fields&gt;}, &lt;No data fields&gt;}, _M_p = 0x513b568 "a.c"}}, Line = 4, Column = 11}
</code></pre>

<p>From <code>gdb</code> output, I know <code>a.c</code> is stored in <code>CI.getFrontendOpts().CodeCompletionAt</code> while <code>main.c</code> is stored in <code>CI.getFrontendOpts().Inputs[0]</code></p>

<h4>Analyze YouCompleteMe with libclang</h4>

<p>Entry point for code completion from <code>libclang</code> is <code>clang_codeCompleteAt</code> and eventually it call to <code>ASTUnit::CodeComplete()</code>. And at end of this function, it also call <code>ASTFrontendAction::ExecuteAction()</code> same as <code>clang</code> from command line. It also has input file defined by <code>Clang-&gt;getFrontendOpts().Inputs[0]</code>. Up to this point, my thought become clear, my target is how to make <code>Clang-&gt;getFrontendOpts().Inputs[0]</code> set to <code>main.c</code> with all the passed in parameters.</p>

<h3>My Hacking</h3>

<h4>The First Fail Hack</h4>

<p>My first attemp is rather simple, as I stated in my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21746668/configure-vim-youcompleteme-for-special-project-structure">StackOverflow question</a>. When call <code>clang_codeCompleteAt()</code>, pass <code>complete_filename</code> in form of <code>path_of_file_to_complete:path_of_file_for_clang_to_parse</code>. This attempt failed because it won&rsquo;t even run to the point of <code>ASTUnit::CodeComplete()</code>. Along the calling path, there are other function check and parse the input file, my hacking filename format is an invalid filename for those functions.</p>

<h4>The Second Fail Hack</h4>

<p>I understand that <code>Clang-&gt;getFrontendOpts()</code> is parsed from the passed flags, so my second attempt of hacking is to pass <code>main.c</code> together with flags. So I hardcode <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> to append absolute path of <code>main.c</code> in <code>flags</code>, but <code>Clang-&gt;getFrontendOpts().Inputs[0]</code> was not set to <code>main.c</code> when I check at <code>ASTUnit::CodeComplete()</code>. So this attempt failed.</p>

<h4>The Third Successful But Dirty Hack</h4>

<p>After failed previous two attempts, I only have the option to do dirty hacking by change <code>libclang</code> API and related functions, as well as related parts in <code>YouComplteMe</code>. The idea was to pass in additional <code>input_filename</code> together with <code>complete_filename</code>. And at <code>ASTUnit::CodeComplete()</code>, if this <code>input_filename</code> is valid, use it to replace <code>Clang-&gt;getFrontendOpts().Inputs[0]</code>. This attempt works!!!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>To solve my problem, I was forced to read source code of <code>YouCompleteMe</code> and <code>clang</code>. The hacking process takes time because of code reading, compilation and debugging, and it&rsquo;s disappointed to find out my attempt didn&rsquo;t work as expected. But I really enjoy the moment when the code worked after some days&#8217; struggling. This whole hacking process is just another proof that open source is really good, you can do any hacking to fit your own need.</p>

    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/02/10/windows-data-backup-using-freefilesync-step-by-step</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article is the step by step guide that I prepared for my colleagues to do the data backup to our newly bought server. I was assigned the task to evaluate some backup tools and find the best one that fits our requirements. After some testing, I finally choose FreeFileSync. I choose it over other tools because it has a feature I like most:</p>

<p>I can mirror folders to backup server, so the backup server is always the latest copy, when I restore, I just copy this folder back to its location; while for those modified / deleted files, they will be saved in another dedicated loation with Date as version.</p>

<p>OK. Here begins the step by step guide.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><code>FreeFileSync</code> is a free Open Source software that helps you synchronize files and synchronize folders for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. It is designed to save your time setting up and running backup jobs while having nice visual feedback along the way.</p>

<p><code>FreeFileSync</code> latest vesrion is 6.2. For more information about this software, can visit its <a href="http://freefilesync.sourceforge.net">homepage</a></p>

<h3>Download &amp; Install FreeFileSync</h3>

<p>Visit <a href="http://freefilesync.sourceforge.net/download.php">here</a> to download the latest version of <code>FreeFileSync</code></p>

<p>After download finished, run the downloaded exe file to start setup. You can choose normal installation or portable installation.</p>

<h3>Setup FreeFileSync For Data Backup</h3>

<p>The backup scheme that we doing to define should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Daily backup data of selected folders.</li>
<li>Keep the origin folder structure.</li>
<li>Keep deleted file for up to 30 days.</li>
<li>Keep older copy when file been modified.</li>
<li>No compression on backup file/folder.</li>
<li>Log file for backup status.</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/02/08/thoughts-after-read-the-power-of-habit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have finished the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055PGUYU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0055PGUYU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zhuyong.me-20">&ldquo;The Power Of Habit&rdquo;</a> one week ago. This is an interesting, easy reading and transformative book. It uses plenty of examples to explain how habits been created, changed for individuals, organization and the whole society.</p>

<p>The concept of <code>habit loop</code> is simple, it consists of a cue, a routine and a reward. No matter good or bad habits, they all been created following this loop with or without our awareness.</p>

<p>Habits once formed, it won&rsquo;t be forgotten, it can only be changed, and the changed part is the <code>routine</code>. The changing process at the beginning might be hard and slow, we might turn to the old routine some time, that&rsquo;s why patient and persistent is important in the process of habit changing. One tactic is to aim one keystone habit, keystone habit changing will radially change orther habits in the process.</p>

<p>In the book it also mentioned willpower, there is a pool for willpower with limited quantity, and it is shared for all our mind control activities. Good news is that willpower can be trained, trained willpower has larger pool and it will not shrink later.</p>

<p>I am applying the tactics in this book to change some of my &ldquo;bad&rdquo; habits, and I already see progress. That&rsquo;s wonderful to see the progress, the happiness and satisfaction is also <code>reward</code> for me.</p>

<p><strong>Be Patient, Be Persistent</strong></p>

    <link href="http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/02/05/add-related-posts-section-to-octopress/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-05T12:39:53+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/02/05/add-related-posts-section-to-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When reading someone&rsquo;s article, it&rsquo;s good to have a section to show the releated posts. Today I searched online and found to add <code>Related Posts</code> section to Octopress is quite easy.</p>

<p>First, edit config file <code>_config.yml</code> to add line</p>

<pre><code>lsi: true
</code></pre>

<p>Second, create file <code>source/_includes/post/related_posts.html</code> with content below</p>

<pre><code>{% if site.related_posts %}
  &lt;h3&gt;Related posts&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;ul class="posts"&gt;
  {% for post in site.related_posts limit:3 %}
    &lt;li class="related"&gt;
      &lt;a href="{{ root_url }}{{ post.url }}"&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  {% endfor %}
  &lt;/ul&gt;
{% endif %}
</code></pre>

<!-- more -->


<p>Next, add this footer section to the post. modify <code>source/_layouts/post.html</code> to add line</p>

<pre><code>{% include post/related_posts.html %}
</code></pre>

<p>under</p>

<pre><code>{% include post/author.html %}
{% include post/date.html %}{% if updated %}{{ updated }}{% else %}{{ time }}{% endif %}
{% include post/categories.html %}
</code></pre>

<p>OK. Now you can run <code>rake generate</code> and <code>rake preview</code> to see the effects.</p>

<p>There is one problem with the solution above, it&rsquo;s slow to run <code>rake generate</code> when your have lots of articles. To speed up the process, you need to install <code>rb-gsl</code>. If you directly issue <code>gem install gsl</code>, your most probablly will see error message</p>

<pre><code>Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing gsl:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

...
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s because <code>gsl</code> gem requires <code>gsl 1.14</code>. Follow the steps below to install <code>gsl 1.14</code> and <code>rb-gsl</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -O http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/gnu/gsl/gsl-1.14.tar.gz
$ tar xfz gsl-1.14.tar.gz
$ cd gsl-1.14
$ ./configure
$ make clean
$ make                              # can take a while, be patient
$ sudo make install
$ sudo gem install gsl
</code></pre>

<p>Now run <code>rake generate</code> again and feel the acceleration for the classification process. If you are unlucky and see the message below:</p>

<pre><code>Notice: for 10x faster LSI support, please install http://rb-gsl.rubyforge.org/
</code></pre>

<p>This means your <code>rb-gsl</code> installation got problem. To resolve that, first uninstall <code>gsl</code> by</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo gem uninstall gsl
</code></pre>

<p>Then edit file <code>Gemfile</code> in your Octopress folder to add line</p>

<pre><code>gem 'gsl', '~&gt;1.14.7'
</code></pre>

<p>Then use <code>bundle</code> to install <code>gsl</code></p>

<pre><code>$ sudo bundle install
</code></pre>

<p>Again, run <code>rake generate</code> to feel the fly speed. :)</p>

<p>Good Luck!!!</p>

    <link href="http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/02/04/google-released-chromecast-sdk/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-04T09:39:48+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/02/04/google-released-chromecast-sdk</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="http://10.36.134.34:4000/blog/2014/01/25/i-received-my-chromecast/">received my Chromecast</a> for 10 days, I received good news from Google. Google finally <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.sg/2014/02/chromecast-is-now-open-to-developers.html">opened chromecast SDK to all developers</a>. This is what Chromecast users and developers waiting for long time. Developers now must be busy coding to integrate the SDK into their apps, so countless Chromecast-compatible apps would show-up any day now.</p>

<p>Media player apps will be the first batch to support Chromecast, especially for local media streaming. I think this is the most desired feature for most of Chromecast users including me. I use MX Player a lot, I can&rsquo;t wait to see it with Chromecast support.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t play games on phone, but I think there will be plenty of games with Chromecast support. People likes to play games on large screen, supporting for Chromecast would be a must have feature for any android games from now on.</p>

<p>For developers, check the two links below to start your development.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/downloads">Chromecast SDK Download</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/developers">Chromecast Developer Guide</a></li>

    <link href="http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/01/28/half-day-with-allure-eyewear-call-of-duty-ghost/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-28T17:42:29+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/01/28/half-day-with-allure-eyewear-call-of-duty-ghost</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just before lunch time, security guard at reception desk called me to collect my parcel. I knew my 3 pieces of <code>Call Of Duty : Ghost</code> have arrived. I placed order on 23 Jan and it only takes 5 days for international shipping, the speed is fast enough for a US$20 delivery.</p>

<p>My excutement and happiness didn&rsquo;t last long until I opened the box and only see two pieces of eyeware inside. I immediately opened my order online and checked carefully, yes, the invoice stated clearly that I ordered 3 pieces of eyewear, but I only got 2 of them shipped. And there is only 1 shipment number, so I guess there won&rsquo;t be a second package on the way. Next I immediately sent an email through the online contact form, but I think it will take some hours before I got response due to the different timezone. Let&rsquo;s wait and see how <code>Allure</code> reply.</p>

<p>After lunch time, I clipped the eyewear onto my glass and used it for the whole afternoon. So here is how I feel about this eyewear with one afternoon experience:</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>I felt a little giddy at first, guess is due to the 0.2 diopter. But my eyes soon get used to it.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a little bit heavy for this clip-on eyewear + my glass</li>
<li>When the time I left company, my eyes didn&rsquo;t have strong dry feeling as usual. I can confirm this is not due to phychological factor. I can really feel it. Tomorrow I will use it for whole day, I think the feel will be clearer.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s troublesome to take off the eyewear when I left my cubicle to pantry or toilet, then put on again.</li>
</ul>


<p>Basically, this product worth the US$25 price, I would suggest this for anyone who work on computer for long hours. Of course, if you already wear glass and have the budget, I strongly suggest go to the <code>gunnar</code> customization option.</p>

<p><code>Update 2014-02-04</code> : I contacted <code>Allure</code> on 28 Jan, and they processed another shipment for the 3rd eyewear at U.S locat time <code>01/29/2014  5:19 P.M</code>. I must say their action and response was really fast. For this reason, I would recommend <code>Allure</code> to anyone that interested to buy eyeware to protect their eyes.</p>

    <link href="http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/01/25/how-i-use-google-keep-to-manage-todo-list/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-25T10:18:34+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhuyong.me/blog/2014/01/25/how-i-use-google-keep-to-manage-todo-list</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com">Pomodoro Technique</a> at office, although I don&rsquo;t follow it strictly, the technique did improve my productivity, and it&rsquo;s very effective. I use <a href="http://www.tomighty.org/">Tomighty</a> desktop timer, it&rsquo;s free and opensource. Then for the todo list, I use Google Keep, I don&rsquo;t really record down how many <code>pomodori</code> I spend on a task. The main reason for me to apply <code>Pomodoro Technique</code> is to make me stay focus and concentrate. Google Keep is not dedicated application for todo list, its capability to support todo list simply enought for my requirements.</p>

<p>Just as other Google product, Google Keep interface is clean and minimal, they have Chrome App and Android App. And the best part of Google Keep is its sync function, you can modify your Google Keep on multiple devices and they all sync to your Google account.</p>

<p>Below is my practice to use Google Keep as my todo list.</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>For everyday todo list, I create a Googe Keep entry, titled with the date.</li>
<li>I only keep recent few days&#8217; todo list, older entries will be archived</li>
<li>Every night, I will review today&rsquo;s todo list, copy those items that not finished and need to continue tomorrow to a new Keep entry, titled as tomorrow&rsquo;s date. Then add new list items if there are.</li>
<li>Then I will arrange those items in priority order</li>
<li>Next day, I will try to follow the order to finish the tasks.</li>
<li>Once a task is done, after marking as done, I will move it to the bottom of the list, then start work on the next item.</li>
<li>There is also a special Keep entry function as the pool to keep <code>Todo Items Later</code>. I constantly review and upate items in this entry.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are many note taking or todo list softwares, I also use <code>Evernote</code> and <code>Microsoft OneNote</code> for other purpose. So far, I am quite happy with the way I use Google Keep. You may use any note takeing software in whatever style, as long as it helps for your life or work.</p>
