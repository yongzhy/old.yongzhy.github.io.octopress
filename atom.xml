    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I bought my first personal domain <a href="http://zhuyong.me">zhuyong.me</a> and pointed to <a href="http://yongzhy.github.io">my github pages</a>.</p>

<p>The reason why I bought domain is to push myself, to encourage myself to continously update this blog. Plus, the domain + 1 year pravacy protection only cost US$8.99 under current promotion.</p>

<p>The setup is pretty easy:</p>

<ol>
<li>create <code>CNAME</code> file under <code>source/</code> folder. In this file, just input my newly bought domain: <strong>zhuyong.me</strong></li>
<li>run <code>rake generate</code> to put <code>CNAME</code> in <code>master</code></li>
<li>setup DNS, I bought my domain from <a href="http://www.namecheap.com">namecheap</a>. So just point <code>zhuyong.me</code> to <code>192.30.252.153</code>, and <code>192.30.252.154</code>, then point <code>www.zhuyong.me</code> to <code>yongzhy.github.io.</code></li>
<li>that&rsquo;s all, just wait for less than 30mins, the domain is updated and I have <code>zhuyong.me</code> now pointed to my github pages.</li>
</ol>

    <id>http://yongzhy.github.io/blog/2014/01/08/setup-acer-c720-chromebook-as-development-computer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is my second day with Acer C720 chromebook. After two days usage, my impression on chromebook is totally impressive. My initial intension was to buy a Macbook Pro 13 retina display. But while waiting for the Apple &ldquo;Red Friday&rdquo; discount before Chinese New Year, I was thinking again and again &ldquo;do I really need to buy a powerful Macbook Pro that cost over S$2000?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have a powerful laptop at home now, but because of its bad battery life, everytime I use it, I need to plug in the power adapter. I can only use laptop after the two kids went to sleep, and I want to use it when on the bed.  The requirement to connect to power adapter just keep me away from use that laptop. What I need is a device with very good battery life and meet the requirements below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Battery must be last at least 5-7 hours</li>
<li>Must have keyboard, one of the main task of this device is for me to write blog or code on bed before sleep.</li>
<li>Can run vim, I use it as my primary code editor</li>
<li>x86 CPU, no need to be very powerful</li>
<li>Hard disc space no hard requirement, as long as there are few GB left for me to install some development tools</li>
<li>Memory at least 4GB</li>
</ul>


<p>Acer C720 meet all requirement except the 4GB RAM, it&rsquo;s because 4GB version is out of stock on Amazon. And because of Singapore telco Starthub promotion, someone was selling cheap of C720 after they got this as free when sign broadband contract with Starhub. So I just contact one guy in a forum and offer S$300 for this 2GB version C720.</p>

<p>I got it yesterday after work. After dinner, I started the process to install Ubuntu 13.10 using crouton. The process was very smooth. Below are what I have done to setup my chromebook.</p>

<ul>
<li>enable developer mode</li>
<li>install Ubuntu 13.10 using crouton</li>
<li>install vim, git, build_essential, cmake, golang1.2, llvm3.4</li>
<li>build the_silver_searcher, YouCompletme for vim</li>
<li>install ruby and necessary setup for blog system Octopress</li>
</ul>


<p>After all of those setup, I still have over 7GB space left, that&rsquo;s far better than my expection. My overall experience on this chromebook is excellet. But if there are other choices of chrombook available, I would want a configuration with 4GB RAM, 32GB SSD. Current 2GB RAM is just not enough for serious development.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night when I tried to setup Octopress on my new bought Acer C720 chromebook, I found that Octopress website doesn&rsquo;t have the guide on how to setup Octopress on multiple computer. After search online, there are quite a lot people have seen the same problem. And I did found a very nice guide by Robert Anderson at <a href="http://blog.zerosharp.com/clone-your-octopress-to-blog-from-two-places/">here</a>. Here I will just list down the steps for my later on reference.</p>

<p>clone <code>source</code> branch to local folder</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone -b source https://github.com/yongzhy/yongzhy.github.io octopress
</code></pre>

<p>clone <code>master</code> branch to <em>_deploy</em> subfolder</p>

<pre><code>$ cd octopress
$ git clone https://github.com/yongzhy/yongzhy.github.io _deploy
</code></pre>

<p>configuration</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ rake setup_github_pages
</code></pre>

<h3>To push changes from two different computers</h3>

<p>Push everything on working computer before switch computer, using commands below:</p>

<pre><code>$ rake generate
$ git add .
$ git commit -am "commit message"
$ git push origin source
$ rake deploy
</code></pre>

<p>Then on the new computer, run commands below to sync.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd octopress
$ git pull origin source
$ cd ./_deploy
$ git pull origin master
</code></pre>

    <id>http://yongzhy.github.io/blog/2013/12/11/shift-my-personal-blog-to-github</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven&rsquo;t updated <a href="http://yongzhy.blogspot.com">my old blog</a> for long time, one of the reason is because it&rsquo;s not easy to post a blog with code snippets on blospot. Few days back, I came by an article mentioned blogging on Github; after read through the article, I felt that&rsquo;s the blog engine I really want. My blog is all about programming stuff, so static pages would fulfill my requriements. Blogging on Github require some initial setup, but with <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, the task becomes simple. Just follow the documents on Octopress website, you can have your personal blog on Github in few minutes.</p>

<p>To me, I think blogging on Github has following benefits you might also want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Version control with git, not only your post been version controlled, but also, you make yourself familiar with git</li>
<li>Very nich code snippets sharing</li>
<li>Writting in Markdown, no need to care much about formatting and stylem. Just follow Markdown syntax, and it is easy</li>
<li>Unlimited space to store your contents.</li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway, this marks my first blog on Github.</p>
