      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t remember when did I joined Amazon&amp;rsquo;s affiliate program, and I can&amp;rsquo;t remember I ever earned a single penny from this program. That&amp;rsquo;s why I was so surprised and happy when I found out that I have earned over US$50 from Amazon during the Black Friday week. After checked Amazon&amp;rsquo;s report, I know all those links were not from my blog, those are from the links I posted on Facebook and one online forum after I purchased &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHRYRLY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00KHRYRLY&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=zhuyong.me-20&amp;amp;linkId=5VFWEDLJIRJOG7TM&#34;&gt;SanDisk Extreme Pro 480GB SSD&lt;/a&gt;. I shared the deal because I think it was a good deal, now I regret I didn&amp;rsquo;t post to more forums. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Amazon earning report page, I can trace back history up to few years, and I noticed that there are 5 clicks from this blog for Q1 2014, 2 clicks for Q2 2014 and 10 clicks for Q3 2014. None of the 17 clicks was converted to success purchase. I know this time I earn this US$50 is because of the shopping season, I don&amp;rsquo;t know when could I make the second US$50 from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember this little surprise, I have captured my Q4 earning to date.&lt;/p&gt;
